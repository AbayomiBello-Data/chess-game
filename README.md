A chessboard is an eight-by-eight grid of squares. A queen is a chess piece that can move on the chessboard any number of squares along any row, column, or diagonal. A queen is attacking another piece if in a single move, it can move to the square the piece is on without jumping over any other piece. (In other words, if the other piece is in the line of sight of the queen, then it is attacked by it.) The eight queens problem poses the question of how eight queens can be placed on a chessboard without any queen attacking another queen.
